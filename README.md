# clustering-molecule
This GitHub repository contains code and data for clustering molecules with the ChEMBL database. The code is written in Python and uses the following libraries:
1.Pandas
2.Scikit-learn
3.RDKit
4. chembel websource client
5. mol2grid
6. sklearn

The data is from the ChEMBL database, which is a freely available database of bioactive molecules.

This repository can be used for a variety of purposes, such as:

Identifying new drug candidates that are similar to known drugs
Understanding the relationship between the structure and activity of molecules
Designing new molecules with specific properties
To use this repository, you can follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required Python libraries.
Run the cluster_molecules.py script.
This script will cluster the molecules in the ChEMBL database using K-means clustering. The results of the clustering will be saved in a file called clusters.csv.

You can then analyze the clusters to identify groups of molecules that are similar to each other. For example, you could look at the average biological activity of each cluster to identify clusters of molecules that have similar biological activity.

Example use cases

This repository can be used for a variety of purposes, such as:

Drug discovery: Researchers can use this repository to identify new drug candidates that are similar to known drugs. This can help to accelerate the drug discovery process.
Materials science: Researchers can use this repository to understand the relationship between the structure and activity of molecules. This can help to design new materials with specific properties.
Computational biology: Researchers can use this repository to study the molecular basis of biological processes.
